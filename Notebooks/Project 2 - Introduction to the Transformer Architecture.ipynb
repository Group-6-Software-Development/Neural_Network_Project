    "After running the code for text classification using a Transformer encoder, here’s what we observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The IMDB dataset was downloaded, containing pre-tokenized movie reviews categorized as positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reviews were padded to a fixed sequence length of 200 for uniformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model was trained for 3 epochs with a batch size of 32.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The training accuracy improved significantly, starting from 70% and reaching over 96% by the final epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Validation accuracy, however, peaked early at 88%, suggesting possible overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the test set, the model achieved an accuracy of 85%, indicating strong performance in distinguishing positive and negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** The gap between training accuracy (96%) and test accuracy (85%) suggests the model may benefit from regularization techniques like dropout or early stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loss Trends:** Training loss decreased consistently, while validation loss started to increase, further highlighting overfitting.\n",

    "- **Test Accuracy:** A solid performance on unseen data demonstrates the effectiveness of the Transformer encoder for text classification tasks."

    "After running the generative language model for 3 epochs, the results were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model’s accuracy started very low, at 0% in the first epoch, but gradually increased, reaching 48.98% by the third epoch. This slow increase suggests that the model is still in the early stages of learning the structure of the Shakespearean text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The loss decreased from 9.93 in the first epoch to 9.45 in the final epoch, indicating improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generated Text:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model was used to generate text starting with the seed: \"To be or not to be, that is the question.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- The output shows that the model has learned some aspects of Shakespeare’s style but is still struggling with coherent word choices. It outputs \"<UNK>\" (unknown tokens) frequently, which indicates it is encountering words it hasn't seen before in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model’s text generation is still rudimentary, with random sequences, but it gives a sense of how the model is learning patterns in the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Learning Curve:** The model's performance improved slowly over time, which is typical for generative models trained on complex text data like Shakespeare's works.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Quality:** The output demonstrates the model's ability to generate text in the correct format (e.g., punctuation and sentence structure), but it still produces many nonsensical words (\"<UNK>\"), showing it hasn't fully learned the language structure."

    "# 5. Summary, Conclusions, and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we implemented and evaluated three key NLP tasks using Transformer architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Classification with Transformer Encoder** (Chapter 11.4): We built a model for sentiment analysis of movie reviews, achieving good accuracy despite some signs of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Machine Translation with Transformer** (Chapter 11.5): We trained a sequence-to-sequence model for English-Portuguese translation, demonstrating solid performance with room for further improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generative Language Modeling with Transformer** (Chapter 12.1): A model was trained on Shakespeare's works for text generation, producing creative but incoherent outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transformer Encoders** are powerful tools for text classification, but may require regularization to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Translation** showed the potential of Transformers for sequence-to-sequence tasks, though further tuning could enhance translation quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generative Models** demonstrated the ability to produce novel text, but more epochs and data would likely improve the coherence of generated sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges Faced:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting in Classification:** The text classification model showed signs of overfitting, with performance on the training set higher than on the validation and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Constraints:** The generative model’s output was limited by the small size and complexity of the training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Time:** Complex models like Transformers, especially with large datasets, require significant computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Work and Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization Techniques:** Apply techniques like dropout or early stopping to prevent overfitting in text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Architectures:** Experiment with BERT or GPT-style models for more advanced NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Augmentation:** Expand datasets for translation and text generation tasks to improve model robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune model parameters like learning rates and batch sizes for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Improved Tokenization:** Use subword tokenization (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding) to handle rare words more effectively in translation and generative tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring these avenues, we can further improve the models’ performance and extend their application to more complex tasks in NLP."
